## Project 1 — Automated Pitch Deck & Brand Matchmaking System

**Context / Problem**  
Sales and partnership teams were spending ~30 minutes per pitch deck, manually sourcing brand data and customizing slides. Errors from rushed work affected ~25% of decks. Adoption of the process was only 50% due to complexity.

**Solution**
- Built a HubSpot automation allowing Growth Partners and internal teams to instantly generate sales decks.
- Integrated brand-to-partnership matchmaking logic for product placement and co-promo targeting.
- Added Canva Enterprise and Make.com to fully automate deck production, formatting, and brand assets.
- Delivered targeted training to bring all team members to full adoption.

**Impact**
- **Time Savings:** 30 min → 30 sec per deck (96% faster).  
  25 projects/week × 29.5 min saved = ~615 hrs/year freed.  
  At $60/hour loaded cost = ~$37K/year capacity gain.
- **Error Rate:** 25% → <5% (limited to minor formatting).
- **Adoption:** Increased from 50% → 100% within 4 weeks post-training.
- **Scope:** 20 team members, 1,200+ decks/year.
- **Longevity:** Still in use; now evolving with AI-powered personalization for pitches.
- **Unexpected Win:** More time for research before calls → improved sales preparedness and pitch quality.

## Project 2 — Tech Stack Consolidation & HubSpot ↔ Monday Automation

**Context / Problem**  
100+ monday.com boards and duplicate manual data entry into HubSpot created inefficiency and inconsistent reporting. Legal documents lacked tracking, leading to delays in SOW completion. Tool sprawl increased costs and confusion.

**Solution**
- Established HubSpot as the central data source, with monday.com focused solely on project execution.
- Automated data flow: IMDb → HubSpot → synced to monday.com.
- Added PandaDoc to automate contracts/SOWs, with real-time status tracking.
- Audited tool usage, removing underused subscriptions and reallocating budget to team learning & development.

**Impact**
- **Time Savings:** Eliminated 15 min duplicate entry × 100+ tasks/month = 300 hrs/year saved (~$18K/year).
- **Cost Savings:** Tool consolidation saved ~$12K/year in license fees.
- **Data Accuracy:** Reduced mismatched entries from ~20% → <2%.
- **Scope:** Full agency workflow; 100% of projects run through the system.
- **Longevity:** System in continuous improvement; new triggers and automations added quarterly.
- **Unexpected Win:** Teams gained clarity on “which tool for what,” improving collaboration and reducing onboarding time for new hires.

## Project 3 — Agency “Ways of Working” System & Admin Automation

**Context / Problem**  
Each new project launch required PMs to manually create boards, trackers, and communication channels — ~30 min/project — and approaches varied by PM. This caused inconsistencies, setup errors, and wasted time.

**Solution**
- Automated monday.com board & tracker generation from a single project intake form.
- Integrated Microsoft Teams automation to instantly create structured communication channels for each new project.
- Created a central landing page housing SOPs, templates, and quick-start guides for all processes.

**Impact**
- **Time Savings:** 30 min → 1 min setup (97% faster).  
  30+ projects/month × 29 min saved = 174 hrs/year (~$10.4K/year).
- **Error Rate:** Eliminated setup errors; 100% process compliance achieved.
- **Scope:** All 20 team members; 360+ projects/year.
- **Longevity:** Still in use, updated quarterly with process refinements.
- **Unexpected Win:** Freed PM focus for client work; improved morale and delivery consistency.
