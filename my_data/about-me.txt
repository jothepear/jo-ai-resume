🌟 Personal Profile: Jo Gruszka

🧠 Professional Snapshot
Executive Director of Operations with 10+ years of experience leading GTM strategy, marketing operations, and content innovation across B2B SaaS, tech, and agency landscapes. I’m part strategist, part artist, part operations ninja — and I build systems that scale good ideas. Known for proactively tackling challenges before they become problems, I’m the one who sees the fire and already has the extinguisher in hand.

I turn ideas into reality with efficient outlines, beautiful spreadsheets, and structured execution. I’m the glue that holds teams (and friendships) together — intuitive, steady, and solutions-focused. I don’t just manage operations; I humanize them.

- Input: Constantly absorbing and synthesizing knowledge.
- Achiever: Energized by execution and excellence.
- Developer: Committed to nurturing growth in others.
- Relator: Builds trust and connection through honesty.
- Learner: A lifelong explorer of ideas and systems.
