When Tony Stark built his first suit, he crashed into a wall. When the Stranger Things crew faced the Upside Down, they had zero prep. Even the Fast & Furious team needed a minute to figure out how to drive a car off a plane.

Pop culture knows this: new tools come with a learning curve ‚Äî but they change the game.

And the same is true in business.

I manage operations and change management ‚Äî and I‚Äôve implemented over 30 tools across CRMs, contracts, creative workflows, and campaign execution.

Some flopped.

Some took off.

But all of them taught me that fear is part of the process ‚Äî and still worth pushing through.

Why new tools spark resistance:
Fear of looking like you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing
No time to learn ‚Äúyet another‚Äù platform
Comfort in the old way of doing things

 But here‚Äôs the truth: comfort doesn‚Äôt scale. Clarity, curiosity, and change do.

I‚Äôve used tools like:
PandaDoc ‚Äì simplify contracts, proposals, and internal documentation
HubSpot or Salesforce ‚Äì manage CRM, pipeline reporting, and lead tracking
monday.com or Asana ‚Äì cross-functional project visibility and workflow automation
Klear or ContentStudio.io ‚Äì track/optimize influencer/social media campaigns performance
Seamless AI or Winmo ‚Äì for prospecting and smarter lead generation
‚Ä¶and plenty more that didn‚Äôt survive the audit (because not every tool earns a permanent seat)

It‚Äôs not just about the tech ‚Äî it‚Äôs about the rollout.

Here‚Äôs what I do to make sure tools drive real efficiency:

Map the tool to a real problem - miro or any other white board tool
Train visually and simply - loom walkthroughs, cheat sheets, real-world examples
Explain the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù first - change sticks when people see purpose
Start small, optimize fast - feedback loops are everything
Celebrate small wins - time saved is culture changed

This is more than implementation.

It‚Äôs operational design - and it‚Äôs how I build forward-thinking teams.

What happens after the discomfort?
The real ROI goes beyond hours saved or dashboards cleaned up.

It shows up in how we think, move, and lead.

Teams stop reacting and start anticipating
People stop waiting and start solving
Work becomes lighter, faster, and more strategic

And all of that happens because we decided not to fear the tool, but to make it work.

üéØ Final Thought
No one is ever ready for a new system.

No one wants another login.

But if you‚Äôre leading change, here‚Äôs what I know:

The discomfort fades.
The clarity grows.
And what you‚Äôre left with is a business that runs smoother, grows faster, and thinks bigger.

And Why Proactiveness Is the Key
A year ago, I joined a new team remotely, coffee in hand, Teams already pinging, juggling three browser tabs and an ambitious to-do list. I knew I was stepping into a fast-paced environment where I could make an impact. What I didn‚Äôt know was just how collaborative, creative, and rewarding the journey would be.

The past year has been full of ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ what?‚Äù moments that turned into real wins. (And let‚Äôs be honest, sometimes those wins looked suspiciously like wrangling HubSpot.) The biggest highlight? The relationships. Learning from my team, growing alongside them, and getting to help others move through roadblocks more efficiently‚Äîthat‚Äôs been the best part.

So as I reflect, I keep coming back to one question:

What does success mean to you?

It‚Äôs a question I ask often, in interviews, networking conversations, and personal check-ins. Now, I‚Äôve started using it as a tool with my team. We‚Äôve even started building individual growth plans to help define and support what success looks like for each person, not just the company.

Here‚Äôs what success means to me:

Success is staying in a state of flow while creating the life I want to live.

I hit that flow when I‚Äôm building new systems that help teams work smarter, not harder. It‚Äôs not about process for the sake of control, it‚Äôs about giving people clarity and confidence, so they can spend less time spinning and more time thriving.

But here‚Äôs the thing: you don‚Äôt get to flow without proactiveness.

Proactiveness = Momentum

Proactiveness creates the conditions for success. It gives us the awareness to identify what matters, the initiative to solve problems early, and the courage to speak up when something‚Äôs unclear. It‚Äôs not about doing more, it‚Äôs about leaning in with purpose.

One framework I developed with my team is called:

The 3 Modes of Work: Waiting, Asking, Acting

Everyone operates in one of these modes, and moving through them with intention makes all the difference.

WAITING ‚Äì Holding back, unsure, waiting for instruction. 
ASKING ‚Äì Engaging, clarifying, showing curiosity. 
ACTING ‚Äì Anticipating, taking initiative, driving outcomes.

High-performing teams don‚Äôt live in ‚Äúwaiting.‚Äù They move through asking and land in action. That‚Äôs where trust is built. That‚Äôs where innovation lives.

Why It Matters Right Now

In today‚Äôs workplace, especially with younger generations stepping into leadership, we‚Äôre seeing a shift: people want autonomy, trust, and purpose. I‚Äôve seen this firsthand. They don‚Äôt want to be micromanaged, they want to contribute meaningfully, on their terms.

The ‚Äúwaiting, asking, acting‚Äù model isn‚Äôt just about productivity. It‚Äôs about empowerment. It‚Äôs about building teams that are proactive, collaborative, and unafraid to own their success.

The Real Work

Proactiveness also means giving feedback. Speaking up. Paying attention. Success happens when everyone‚Äôs voice is active‚Äînot just heard, but used.

So I‚Äôll ask again:

What does success mean to you?  

And how are you choosing to show up for it?

If you‚Äôre still waiting, that‚Äôs okay, just don‚Äôt stay there. 

Ask. 

Act.

Creating Community: Networking and Belonging with We Are Open To Work

A year ago, I found myself navigating the unexpected challenges of the job market after being laid off. Initially, I felt a sense of relief, as the work environment had been incredibly difficult. However, reality soon set in: the job market was tough, and there were a lot of people vying for the same positions. Companies began to take advantage of this saturated market, lowering salaries and making it even more challenging to find a suitable job. 

As a single mom by choice to an amazing 7-year-old daughter, I felt the weight of responsibility on my shoulders. I was discouraged by the circumstances and recognized that I wanted to help others along the way. Remembering my time at Firewood, where I finally felt like I belonged, I was motivated to recreate that sense of community. 

This desire for connection led me to start we are open to work, a community focused on supporting talented professionals through the ups and downs of job searching. While I‚Äôm not sure how directly we‚Äôve helped, I hope we‚Äôve made a difference in the lives of our members. Over the past year, approximately 25% of our members have secured new jobs, while about 5% returned after their contracts ended. These statistics highlight both the challenges of the job market and the importance of collective effort.

Networking is More Important Than Ever

It‚Äôs no secret that applying through LinkedIn or any traditional job board often feels like a dead end. This is why we need to shift our focus. The power of networking can‚Äôt be overstated. www.weAreOpenToWork.com was created to be more than just a support group; it‚Äôs a platform for talented individuals to connect, share opportunities, and build lasting relationships. 

However, the quality of a collective matters. Its effectiveness largely depends on the engagement within the group and the networks of its members. When we actively participate, we can maximize the benefits of collective networking, opening doors to opportunities we might not find alone.

Networking should be seen as an opportunity for discovery and personal growth. By identifying common interests and aligning our objectives with others, we can create meaningful connections that foster collaboration and lead to longer-lasting professional relationships. It‚Äôs essential to approach networking as a two-way street, where you can also offer value to others. Even small gestures of gratitude, recognition, or fresh perspectives can create significant connections.

I‚Äôve experienced firsthand the transformative power of networking. In August 2023, I attended TechCrunch event, where a chance encounter with Mateusz Owi Owsiany changed the course of my journey. We struck up a conversation while joking about charging people to use the restroom, something that's common in my home country, Poland, because we were stuck right next to it in a very small space, and it was annoying to be moved all the time so people could get through. This lighthearted moment blossomed into a friendship, and we began supporting one another through our professional journeys. Owi even took the time to teach my daughter how to play Roblox and soon, will teach her how to build the experiences games.

In October 2023, I faced the unexpected challenge of being laid off from Monks. Five months later, in February 2024, Owi introduced me to his mentor, Stuart McFaul , highlighting my skills in marketing operations when I shared my portfolio www.jogruszka.com. Stuart recognized my potential and connected me with Hollywood Branded to freelance and assist with operations starting in March 2024. Fast forward to July 2024: I transitioned into a full-time role as Executive Director of Operations.

This experience reinforces a crucial lesson: networking is not just about collecting contacts; it's about cultivating genuine relationships that can lead to unexpected opportunities. we are open to work is more than just a group; it's a movement, encouraging all of us to engage with our networks and support one another in finding new paths forward.

Reflecting on this journey, I can say that we are open to work continues to give me that feeling of belonging, and I am grateful to be part of a community that uplifts each other during these challenging times.
